So, I understand this is primarily a test to see where your programming skills are at, so I did it without checking any answers, or anything like that.

However! If this were a real-world scenario, I likely would've checked to see if there was an already-confirmed implementation, and then would've ran with it from there. Something like [this](http://alfasin.com/a-simple-calculator-in-ruby/) perhaps, with modifications for error handling(you did mention this should be a cleaned up, open sourceable example), and of course, full testing.
